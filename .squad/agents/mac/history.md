# Mac — History

## Learnings
- Project started 2026-02-22. Backend for AI Office Squad.
- AIOffice server at apps/server/ — Express + PTY + WebSocket.
- Server spawns CLI processes (Claude Code / Copilot CLI) in PTYs, bridges JSONL output over WebSocket.
- Need to integrate @bradygaster/squad-cli v0.7.0 for squad-aware agent management.
- Phase 0+1 done: multi-squad building model, team.md parser, squad-scoped endpoints.
- New modules: squad-reader.ts (parses team.md), building-routes.ts (REST API + squad state).
- squad-types.ts added to shared/src/ for cross-package types.
- squadoffice.config.json at project root defines squad directories; auto-detects if missing.
- Agents auto-seeded from .squad/team.md on server startup — no manual spawn needed.
- Scribe and Ralph are hidden (system agents, not NPCs).
- Charter + history files injected as personality context when spawning squad agent PTYs.
- bridgeChatToPty() now loads charter + history from agent's squad member record on first message (Issue #2).
- Squad agents get a tailored prompt with their charter/role context; non-squad agents keep generic office personality.
- Ceremony API added: POST /api/squads/:squadId/ceremonies/:type (start) and POST .../ceremonies/:ceremonyId/end (end).
- parseCeremoniesMd() parses .squad/ceremonies.md into structured CeremonyConfig objects.
- CeremonyType, CeremonyState, CeremonyConfig types added to shared/src/squad-types.ts.
- EventTypeSchema extended with "ceremony.start", "ceremony.end", "decisions.update" in shared/src/schema.ts.
- Enhanced squad status endpoint: GET /api/squads/:squadId/status returns members with live agent cross-reference, blockers, active ceremony, decision count.
- createBuildingRouter now accepts opts param for getAgents() and broadcast() wiring from index.ts.
- In-memory activeCeremonies map tracks running ceremonies; ceremony.start/end broadcast over WebSocket.
- Electron desktop app scaffold created at apps/desktop/ using electron-vite + React.
- Main process (src/main/) owns all Squad SDK state; renderer communicates via typed IPC.
- SquadRuntime class wraps SquadClientWithPool, EventBus, StreamingPipeline, RalphMonitor lifecycle.
- IPC channels: 12 invoke (renderer→main) + 4 push (main→renderer) with IpcResult<T> error wrapping.
- squad-sdk is ESM-only; main process uses dynamic import() for subpath exports.
- types.ts defines shared IpcInvokeChannels/IpcPushChannels maps — single source of truth for channel contracts.
- @electron-toolkit/utils used for `is.dev` check and ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL loading.
- Preload exposes `window.squadAPI` via contextBridge with unsubscribe-returning event listeners.
- Poncho's pre-existing tailwind.config.ts and postcss.config.js in apps/desktop/ — no conflicts with backend scaffold.
- Phase 1a types added: HubStats, SquadInfo, SquadStatus, SessionMetadata, SessionDetail, AgentInSession — all in main/types.ts and mirrored in renderer/types.ts.
- IPC channel `squad:get-session-detail` added: fetches session via listSessions(), cross-references roster + agent statuses, returns SessionDetail.
- IpcInvokeChannels and IpcPushChannels maps updated with new channels (squad:get-session-detail, hub:stats-updated, hub:squad-status).
- Preload exposes `getSessionDetail(sessionId)` method on the squadAPI bridge.
- Vitest added as devDependency, vitest.config.ts created at apps/desktop/ root, test/test:watch scripts in package.json.
- Test directory structure: apps/desktop/src/__tests__/{main,renderer/{hooks,components}}.
- AgentStatus 'busy' maps to AgentInSession 'active' in the session-detail handler (SDK uses busy/idle, UI uses active/idle).
