# Blain — History

## Learnings
- Project started 2026-02-22. Testing for AI Office Squad.
- AIOffice has 22 Playwright integration tests in tests/.
- Playwright config at playwright.config.ts.
- Will need to adapt tests for squad-specific features (member roster, ceremonies, etc.).
- 2026-02-22: Created 3 new test files for building/pod architecture (issues #1, #4, #11-#15):
  - `tests/squad-reader.spec.ts` — 8 tests for parsing .squad/team.md (all passing).
  - `tests/building-api.spec.ts` — 10 tests for GET /api/building/squads, squad details, backward compat. Uses graceful skip when endpoints aren't built yet.
  - `tests/building-scene.spec.ts` — 7 Playwright tests for BuildingScene rendering, pod navigation, NPC squad member names. Also graceful-skips until Poncho/Mac deliver implementation.
- Created `tests/test-data/` with 3 fixture files: team.md (7 members), team-minimal.md (1 member), team-empty.md (no table).
- Pattern: reference parser inline in squad-reader.spec.ts — swap for real import once apps/server/src/squad-reader.ts lands.
- Pattern: building-api and building-scene tests use `test.skip()` when endpoints return 404, so they won't block CI until implementation exists.
- Existing test patterns: SERVER=localhost:3003, cleanupAgents helper, Playwright request fixture for API tests.
- 2026-02-22: Created regression tests for desktop Electron app's session creation crash (3 SDK integration bugs):
  - `apps/desktop/src/__tests__/main/squad-runtime.test.ts` — 16 tests for SquadRuntime lifecycle (initialize, createSession, sendMessage, cleanup)
  - `apps/desktop/src/__tests__/main/ipc-handlers.test.ts` — 18 tests for IPC error handling and IpcResult format
  - All 41 desktop tests passing (7 types.test + 16 squad-runtime + 18 ipc-handlers)
  - Tests verify: connect() is called, sessions are stored in Map, sendMessage uses session.sendAndWait(), cleanup calls shutdown()
  - Tests catch regressions: missing connect(), wrong method names (close vs shutdown), session not stored, SDK unavailable scenarios
  - Mock pattern: Use class-based mocks for SDK constructors (SquadClientWithPool, EventBus, StreamingPipeline, RalphMonitor)
  - Mac fixed bugs IN PARALLEL — tests now verify correct behavior (connect/shutdown/session storage all work)
- **Test infrastructure learning:** Vitest class-based mocks work better than jest.mock for SDK constructors; beforeEach/afterEach cleanup pattern prevents mock pollution; IpcResult<T> wrapper proves essential for error handling in cross-process boundaries. Tests document expected SDK integration — can reuse pattern for future SDK features.
- 2026-02-22: Updated tests for Phase 2 runtime changes (idempotent init, no lazy init, getDecisions, getConnectionInfo):
  - `squad-runtime.test.ts` — now 27 tests (was 16). Added: init idempotency (2nd call no-op), no-retry after failure, concurrent init shares promise, createSession throws "SDK not connected" after failed init, createSession throws "SDK not available" when never initialized, getDecisions reads .squad/decisions.md (+ missing file + error cases + correct path), getConnectionInfo returns proper state (initial/connected/error). Updated lazy-init test to verify new throw behavior.
  - `ipc-handlers.test.ts` — now 24 tests (was 18). Added: squad:get-decisions handler (content, empty, error), squad:get-connection-info handler (connected, error state), squad:create-session "SDK not connected" after failed init. Updated channel registration list to include new channels.
  - All 58 desktop tests passing (7 types + 27 squad-runtime + 24 ipc-handlers).
  - **Key pattern:** Mock `fs/promises` with `vi.mock('fs/promises')` and `vi.mocked(readFile)` for testing runtime methods that read from disk (getDecisions). Doesn't interfere with SDK mocks.
  - **Key pattern:** Test init idempotency by calling initialize() twice and asserting connect() was called only once. Test concurrent init by firing two promises without awaiting first.
- 2026-02-22: Set up Playwright E2E tests for Electron desktop app:
  - Created `apps/desktop/playwright.config.ts` — separate config from root web tests
  - Created `apps/desktop/e2e/fixtures.ts` — custom fixture to launch Electron via `_electron.launch()`, handles cleanup
  - Created `apps/desktop/e2e/app.spec.ts` — 13 E2E tests covering: app launch, window rendering, navigation (building→floor→office), New Session button (crash regression test), keyboard shortcuts (Escape), agent selection, status bar, window size
  - All 13 tests passing — verifies app doesn't crash on New Session click (the bug Mac fixed)
  - Added npm script `test:e2e` to apps/desktop/package.json: builds app then runs Playwright E2E tests
  - **E2E pattern:** Use `import.meta.url` + `fileURLToPath` to get `__dirname` in ES modules (TypeScript ESM mode)
  - **E2E pattern:** Playwright's `_electron.launch()` takes entry point path (`out/main/index.js`), returns `ElectronApplication` with `firstWindow()` method
  - **E2E pattern:** Use generous timeouts (2s initial wait) for Electron startup; use `.waitForTimeout()` after navigation to let React render
  - **E2E pattern:** Graceful selectors with fallbacks (try data-testid, then class, then text filter) — UI may not have test IDs yet
  - **E2E coverage:** Core user flows (launch, navigate, select agent, create session, keyboard shortcuts) plus regression test for session crash
