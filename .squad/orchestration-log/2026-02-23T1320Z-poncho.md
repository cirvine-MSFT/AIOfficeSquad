# Orchestration: Poncho (Frontend) — 2026-02-23T13:20Z

**Spawned:** 2026-02-23T13:20Z

## Summary
Wired live SDK sessions and connection state to App.tsx. Cleaned up duplicated session mapping helpers.

## Outcomes
✓ App.tsx now reads real SDK sessions and connection status
✓ mapSessions() helper created, DRY refactor across 3 call sites
✓ getConnectionInfo() used instead of getStatus() for connection detection

## Context
- Fixed sdkConnected always being false (getStatus() has no connection field)
- Discovered SDK returns sessionId/summary fields that map to SessionSummary interface
- Part of unified SDK wiring with Mac's preload typing and Blain's hook tests
