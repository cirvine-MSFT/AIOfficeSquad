# Orchestration Log: Dutch — Building/Pod/Agent Rearchitecture

**Agent:** Dutch (Lead)  
**Start Time:** 2026-02-22T04:08:00Z  
**Status:** Completed  

## Summary

Dutch rearchitected the project scope around Casey's building/pod/agent spatial vision. Replaced single flat office model with hierarchical scene architecture: BuildingScene → PodScene → Agent UI overlay. This fundamentally reshapes the 10-issue roadmap and adds 7 new foundation issues.

## Actions

- **Scope Decision:** Shifted from flat single office to building metaphor (Building → Pods → Agents)
- **Scene Architecture:** Designed BuildingScene (programmatic pod grid), PodScene (refactored OfficeScene per squad), Agent interaction (UI overlay, no separate scene)
- **Config Model:** Adopted `squadoffice.config.json` for explicit squad discovery (vs auto-scan)
- **API Design:** Hierarchical REST endpoints (`/building` → `/squads/:id` → `/squads/:id/agents/:aid`)
- **Issues Created:** #11–#17 (7 new Phase 0 foundation issues)
- **Issues Updated:** #1–#10 with new scope annotations (multi-squad loading, per-pod interactions, room-level chat)
- **Phase Reorganization:** Introduced Phase 0 as prerequisite (multi-pod foundation)

## Artifacts

- **Decision Document:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/dutch-building-architecture.md` (362 lines)

## Outcome

Building/pod/agent architecture fully specified. All existing issues contextualized within new model. Phase 0 foundation issues ready for Sprint 0 kickoff.
