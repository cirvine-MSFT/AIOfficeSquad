## Task
Build HookPipeline governance panel with IPC channel and UI toggle.

## Work
1. **IPC Channel:** Added `squad:get-hook-activity` invoke channel to SquadRuntime, returned as circular buffer (max 50 events)
2. **Hook Event Type:** Defined `HookEvent` interface with event type, timestamp, affected PII fields, and block reason
3. **Pipeline Integration:** Subscribed to `onHook()` during runtime init; buffers events in circular array
4. **Renderer Component:** Built `HooksPanel.tsx` with event list, toggle button (🛡️) in toolbar alongside Decisions/Cost panels
5. **UI Pattern:** Follows existing panel toggle pattern — single `activePanel` state, 320px side panel, toolbar row

## Result
✅ HooksPanel built and integrated. 7 files modified. Pattern enables easy extension by Poncho for styling. No breaking changes to existing channels.

## Governance Pattern
The panel surfaces hook events (writes blocked, PII scrubbed, permissions requested) in real-time. Team visibility into governance pipeline is a first-class concern.
