# Orchestration Log — Dutch (Lead)

**Date:** 2026-02-22T22:56Z  
**Agent:** Dutch  
**Role:** Tech Lead  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

---

## Spawn

- **Triggered:** Strategy + architecture guidance for Squad Campus rebrand
- **Scope:** Hub-mapping roadmap, Phase 6d prioritization
- **Mode:** Background spawn, research + decision documentation

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Hub-Mapping Architecture Note
- Documented 3-level navigation hierarchy: `Building → Floor → Office`
- Mapped current Phase 1 (single squad) to future Phase 3 (multi-squad hub)
- Identified stable contracts: `useNavigation`, `SquadRuntime` interfaces, IPC handlers
- Designed non-breaking refactor path for Squad SDK hub integration
- Included side benefits: multi-workspace support, demo mode, monorepo patterns

### 2. Phase 6d Priority Guidance
- Evaluated all remaining Phase 6d items post-rebrand
- **Tier 1 (Launch):** Hooks Panel (multi-squad coordination UI)
- **Tier 2 (First Release):** SDK Agent Casting (persistent identity)
- **Tier 3 (Phase 3):** WebSocket Bridge optimization (defer to scale testing)
- Provided 3-week sprint plan with task assignments

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Keep BuildingView structure** even with single squad → forward-ready for Phase 3 hub
2. **Hooks Panel is marquee feature** for Squad Campus launch → shows "campus" metaphor in action
3. **SDK Casting is deferred** post-launch → personality without blocking
4. **WebSocket optimization → Phase 3** once multi-squad stress testing is needed

---

## Quality Gate

- ✅ Architecture note includes implementation roadmap (Phase 1 → 3)
- ✅ Priority guidance includes effort estimates (8h, 12h, 16h)
- ✅ Sprint plan is executable (specific owners, timeline, success metrics)
- ✅ No conflicts with existing decisions
