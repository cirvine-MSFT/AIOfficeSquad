# Orchestration: Hawkins (2026-02-22T18:17)

**Agent:** Hawkins (UI/Design)  
**Mode:** background  
**Model:** claude-opus-4.5  
**Task:** Create interactive HTML mockup of Building/Floor/Office UI concept  
**Status:** Completed  

## Work Done

Created `apps/desktop/mockup.html` demonstrating the visual UI hierarchy:

- **Building View:** Isometric or top-down perspective showing multiple pods/floors stacked vertically. Height/appearance reflects squad count.
- **Floor View:** Interior office space with agent desks, sprites, labels. Each floor is a Squad context.
- **Office View:** Individual session within a squad. Multiple offices per floor (one per active session).
- **Interactions:** Click pod to enter floor; click agent to open office chat/terminal.

Mockup includes:
- Dark theme design tokens applied (navy base, role accent colors)
- Responsive layout showing information density typical of dev tools
- Visual indicators for agent status (active, idle, working)
- Navigation breadcrumbs (Building > Floor name > Agent name)

## Design Decisions

- Dark navy (#0f1117) base with layered surfaces
- 13px body text (dev tool standard, not web standard)
- 8 role colors for agent identification
- Snappy 150ms transitions for UI feedback

## Artifacts

- `apps/desktop/mockup.html` — Interactive HTML mockup
- Design tokens applied and validated in mockup

## Notes

Mockup provides visual validation of the Building/Floor/Office concept before component implementation. Design system foundation ready for React renderer build (Poncho's task).
