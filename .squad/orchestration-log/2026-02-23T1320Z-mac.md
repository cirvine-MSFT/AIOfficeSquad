# Orchestration: Mac (Backend) — 2026-02-23T13:20Z

**Spawned:** 2026-02-23T13:20Z

## Summary
Added onConnectionState callback to preload bridge and typed all preload returns. Later iteration: typed preload bridge with proper IPC result generics.

## Outcomes
✓ onConnectionState preload handler implemented
✓ Preload bridge fully typed with IPC result generics
✓ All preload returns have explicit types

## Context
- Part of SDK wiring initiative to surface connection state to frontend
- Paired with Poncho's App.tsx changes and Blain's hook test coverage
