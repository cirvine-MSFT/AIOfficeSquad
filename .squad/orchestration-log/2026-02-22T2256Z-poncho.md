## Spawn

- **Triggered:** Squad Campus rebrand task

- **BuildingView Update:** Single-floor iteration (preserve 3-level navigation for future Hub SDK mapping)
- **Mode:** Background spawn, async task runner

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Squad Campus Rebrand (12 files)
- Renamed all user-visible "Squad Office" → "Squad Campus" strings
- Updated window titles, headers, panels, buttons, tooltips
- Maintained consistency across Electron + web React components
- Zero broken functionality

### 2. BuildingView Single-Floor Update
- Kept `building → floor → office` hierarchy intact
- Floor-level now shows "Floor 1" (not blanked out)
- Floor selector interactive and renderable
- Forward-compatible with future multi-floor (multi-squad hub) SDK changes
- User can still navigate 3-level tree even with single squad

---

## Quality Gate

- ✅ All 71 existing tests pass
- ✅ No regressions in navigation state machine
- ✅ Rebrand applied consistently across all touched files
- ✅ BuildingView renders without errors
