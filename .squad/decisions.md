### 2026-02-22T03:46:00Z: Project inception
**By:** Casey Irvine
**What:** Adapt AIOffice (pixel-art walkable office for AI agents) for Squad teams. Fork at cirvine-MSFT/AIOfficeSquad. Integrate with @bradygaster/squad-cli and squad agent protocol.
**Why:** Enable visual, interactive squad management — walk up to squad members, chat, see their work, run ceremonies in a pixel-art office.
