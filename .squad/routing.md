# Routing

## Rules

| Pattern | Route to | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Architecture, scope, design decisions, code review | Dutch | Lead makes structural calls |
| React, components, renderer, frontend, UI logic, Tailwind | Poncho | All React component work |
| Electron main process, IPC, Squad SDK, process management | Mac | Backend/main process |
| Tests, Playwright, quality, edge cases, test cases | Blain | Testing and QA |
| Squad SDK, .squad/ files, charters, ceremonies, casting, agent protocol | Billy | Squad domain expertise |
| Design system, colors, typography, layout, visual polish, UX | Hawkins | All visual design work |
| Session logging, decisions merge, history updates | Scribe | Silent — never user-facing |
| Work queue, backlog monitoring, issue tracking | Ralph | Continuous work monitor |

## Fallbacks

- Frontend + Backend overlap → spawn both, Dutch coordinates
- Squad integration touching server code → Mac + Billy
- Unclear scope → Dutch triages
