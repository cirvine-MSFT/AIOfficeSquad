# Routing

## Rules

| Pattern | Route to | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Architecture, scope, design decisions, code review | Dutch | Lead makes structural calls |
| Phaser, UI, pixel art, sprites, web app, frontend, Vite | Poncho | All visual/interactive work |
| Express, server, API, WebSocket, PTY, process management | Mac | Backend infrastructure |
| Tests, Playwright, quality, edge cases, test cases | Blain | Testing and QA |
| Squad CLI, .squad/ files, charters, ceremonies, casting, agent protocol | Billy | Squad domain expertise |
| Session logging, decisions merge, history updates | Scribe | Silent — never user-facing |
| Work queue, backlog monitoring, issue tracking | Ralph | Continuous work monitor |

## Fallbacks

- Frontend + Backend overlap → spawn both, Dutch coordinates
- Squad integration touching server code → Mac + Billy
- Unclear scope → Dutch triages
