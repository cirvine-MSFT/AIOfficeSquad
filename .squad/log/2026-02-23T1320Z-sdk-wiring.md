# Session: SDK Wiring Integration — 2026-02-23T13:20Z

## Spawn Wave
- **Mac:** Preload bridge typed + onConnectionState handler
- **Poncho:** App.tsx integrated with live SDK sessions/connection
- **Blain:** 39 new hook tests (85→124)
- **Mac (iter):** Preload bridge generics finalized

## Outcomes
✓ Live SDK connection state wired to frontend
✓ Session mapping centralized and typed
✓ 39 new tests passing for hook coverage
✓ IPC layer fully typed with generics

## Key Discoveries
- getConnectionInfo() is the correct IPC for connection state (getStatus() is version info only)
- SDK session objects have sessionId/summary fields mapping to SessionSummary interface
- Session mapping logic was duplicated in 3 places; extracted to mapSessions() helper
