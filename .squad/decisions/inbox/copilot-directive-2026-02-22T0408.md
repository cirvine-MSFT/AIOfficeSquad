### 2026-02-22T04:08:07Z: User directive — Visual concept shift
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** The visual metaphor should be an office building / org chart, not a single office. Each squad session is a separate open-space office or "pod" (like Microsoft pods). You walk into a pod to see a team of agents working together. You can talk to the whole room (CLI session). The building holds multiple squads/sessions. Individual agents are visible inside their team's pod doing work. The concept scales from "office workers" to "teams in an office building."
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. This is the core creative vision for the project.
