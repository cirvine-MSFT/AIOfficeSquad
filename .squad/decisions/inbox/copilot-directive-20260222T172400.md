### 2026-02-22T17:24:00Z: User directive — CLI integration
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** Remove Claude Code CLI integration. Default to GitHub Copilot CLI. Integrate with Squad SDK (@bradygaster/squad-sdk) instead of raw CLI spawning.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. The app should be Squad-native, not a generic AI office.
