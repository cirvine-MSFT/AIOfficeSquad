### 2026-02-22T15:48:40Z: User directive — product direction shift
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** Take the video gameyness out. Make it a practical productivity tool, not a novelty game. Hotkey into rooms instead of walking. Squad chat vs individual member chat with easy switching. Click/jump to areas. Keep the visualization but make navigation instant. Terminal integration needs to actually work. Fix label overlap in PodScene.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. This is a fundamental product direction that affects all future work.
