## 2026-02-22T18:28Z: User directive — UI terminology and visual feel
**By:** Casey Irvine (via Copilot)
**What:** 
- Use "squad members" or "members" terminology, NOT "agents" in the UI
- Building hub should feel more "building-y" with lit office windows
- Floor view should feel like looking into open-space pods/offices on a floor — not cards, more like windows you peer into
- Idle members should be visualized at a "water cooler" (standing, chatting, idle)
- Working members should be "sitting at their desk working"
- The vibe should be fun and office-building themed, not sterile dashboard cards
**Why:** User request — core visual identity for Squad Office
