**You're the boss. Claude and Copilot are your employees.**
**Give them desks, assign them work, and watch them build — in a pixel-art office.**

## Try it now

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristianFJung/AIOffice
cd AIOffice
npm i
officeagent demo
```

> Open **http://localhost:3000** — your office is ready. Walk around, assign tasks, be the boss.

## Features

- 🏢 **Your office** — a walkable pixel-art map where each agent gets a desk
- 🤖 **Real AI agents** — Claude Code and Copilot CLI, doing real work
- 💬 **Walk up and chat** — talk to any agent like an NPC
- 🖥️ **Terminal view** — peek over their shoulder and see what they're typing
- 🔄 **Hire and fire** — spawn, reset, and delete agents on the fly
- 🎵 **Vibes** — lo-fi office background music
- ⌨️ **CLI tool** — script your whole team from the terminal

## How It Works

Each agent is a real CLI process (Claude Code or Copilot) running in a PTY. The server watches JSONL output for responses, bridges messages over WebSocket, and Phaser renders it all as a cozy pixel-art office. See [Architecture →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## CLI

```bash
officeagent start                        # Launch the office
officeagent spawn                        # Add a Claude agent
officeagent spawn -n "Bob" -c copilot    # Named Copilot agent
officeagent demo                         # Auto-detect CLIs, full demo
```

## Adding Agents

**From the UI** — click **+**, fill in name, CLI type, working directory, and personality.

**From the terminal:**
```bash
officeagent spawn --name "Alice" --dir ~/projects/myapp --cli copilot
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `WASD` / `Arrows` | Move around |
| `E` / `Enter` | Chat with nearby agent |
| `Esc` / `Space` | Close panel |
| `Tab` | Switch Chat ↔ Terminal |

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**
- At least one AI CLI:
  [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) ·
  [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:server    # API + WebSocket on :3003
npm run dev:web       # Phaser app on :3000
npm test              # 22 Playwright integration tests
```
